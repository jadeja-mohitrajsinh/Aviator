Aviator provides a secure and intuitive space for buyers and sellers to connect, facilitating the purchase and sale of high-end private jets. Our platform empowers sellers to showcase their aircraft and enables buyers to discover their dream jets with ease and confidence.

## About Aviator

Aviator is designed to revolutionize the luxury private jets market by offering a sophisticated platform that caters to the needs of both buyers and sellers. Our goal is to streamline the process of buying and selling private jets, making it efficient, and transparent.


## Getting Started

To get started with Aviator, follow these simple steps:


### Installation:

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide with scripts and explanations:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your repository.

   Explanation: This command clones the repository from the specified URL to your local machine.

2. **Ensure you have PHP installed on your system:**
   You can check if PHP is installed by running:
   ```
   php -v
   ```
   If PHP is installed, you'll see its version information.

   Explanation: This command checks if PHP is installed on your system.

3. **Set up a Firebase project and Firestore database:**
   Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Follow the prompts to set up a Firestore database within your project.

   Explanation: This step creates a new Firebase project and sets up a Firestore database, which will be used to store your data.

4. **Copy the necessary Firebase credentials to your project:**
   After setting up your Firebase project, navigate to the project settings and download the service account credentials file (usually named `firebase-adminsdk.json`). Copy this file to your project directory.

   Explanation: This file contains the necessary credentials for your PHP application to authenticate with Firebase.

5. **Visit the Kreait/Firebase PHP SDK GitHub page:**
   Visit the GitHub page of Kreait/Firebase PHP SDK: https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php. Follow the installation instructions provided there to download the SDK.

   Explanation: Kreait/Firebase PHP SDK is a PHP package that allows you to interact with Firebase services from your PHP code.

6. **Once the SDK is downloaded and included in your project, configure it with your Firebase credentials:**
   In your PHP code, include the Firebase PHP SDK and configure it with the service account credentials you copied earlier.

   ```php
   <?php
   require 'vendor/autoload.php';

   use Kreait\Firebase\Factory;
   use Kreait\Firebase\ServiceAccount;

   $serviceAccount = ServiceAccount::fromJsonFile(__DIR__ . '/path/to/firebase-adminsdk.json');

   $firebase = (new Factory)
       ->withServiceAccount($serviceAccount)
       ->create();

   $database = $firebase->getDatabase();

   // Now you can use $database to interact with Firestore
   ?>
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/firebase-adminsdk.json` with the path to your Firebase service account credentials file.

   Explanation: This PHP script sets up the Firebase PHP SDK with your service account credentials, allowing you to interact with Firebase services, such as Firestore, from your PHP code.

You can save this PHP script in a file (e.g., `firebase_setup.php`) and run it to configure your Firebase credentials in your project. Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual values.

### Running the App:

To run the app, ensure you have a local server environment set up with PHP. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or simply run PHP's built-in server.

1. Start your local server environment.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the PHP server:

   ```
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8000`.
